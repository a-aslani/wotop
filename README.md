## Overview

WOTOP is an openâ€‘source Go framework designed to accelerate backend development with modern architectural patterns. It brings together:

- **Clean Architecture** for strict separation of business logic and infrastructure layers
- **Domainâ€‘Driven Design (DDD)** to model complex domains with clarity
- **Eventâ€‘Driven Microservices** for looselyâ€‘coupled, asynchronous communication
- **Cloudâ€‘Native Microservices** optimized for containerized, orchestrated environments

Additionally, WOTOP integrates core patterns and tools out of the box:

- **CQRS** (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
- **RabbitMQ** message broker
- **Event Sourcing** for appendâ€‘only event storage

## ðŸŽ¯ Features

- **Layered Clean Architecture**  
  Enforces the Dependency Rule, isolating Use Cases, Entities, and Interfaces for maximum testability and maintainability.

- **Domainâ€‘Driven Design**  
  Implements Aggregates, Repositories, and Bounded Contexts so your code mirrors realâ€‘world domain concepts.

- **Eventâ€‘Driven Communication**  
  Builtâ€‘in event bus with publish/subscribe support for decoupled services.

- **Cloudâ€‘Native Ready**  
  Services are containerized and Kubernetesâ€‘friendly, with support for selfâ€‘healing, autoâ€‘scaling, and sidecar integrations.

- **CQRS**  
  Separates read and write workloads into dedicated models for better performance and scalability.

- **RabbitMQ Integration**  
  Reliable, configurable message broker support for asynchronous workflows.

- **Event Sourcing**  
  Appendâ€‘only event store that lets you reconstruct any entityâ€™s state at any point in time.
